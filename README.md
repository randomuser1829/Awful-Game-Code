# Awful Game Code

The title is not joking, the code for this game is really stupid.
Should also mention that it has some heavy language cuz I can do whatever I want with it.
It's incomplete and it doesn't even work.

# Building

Building is really easy unlike that one Linux distro. All you have to do is:

* Make sure you have `gcc`
* Type `mingw32-make` or something... and you're done.
* Don't look at the warnings

# What?

I just made this for fun.
